            looking for<br>
            i’ve focused on shape<br>
            i’d consider it as an outline. outlines carry weight in the seeing of things in the world.<br>
            this was noticed with an increase of interest in poses, poses would re-appear. my body would return to known, i would think ‘ah what is this shape’. what do you think of calling a body, a shape?<br>
            what do you think of calling yourself, form?<br>
            i hope you do not interpret this as a derogatory question, do you call your body as you call a body of water?<br>
            it is sometimes ok to be clear.<br>
            i have started this search through questioning shape, and i have my body to reference. out of sometimes pure <span class="hover-trigger">
            teimosia.<br>
            <span class="hover-box">
            stubborness<br>
            </span>
            </span>but i only have one pair of eyes.<br>
            bodies make shapes.<br>
            i traced the shapes on the notebook, the shape of the clothing i wore. my body was a negative with the environment.<br>
            and i play around with it, as my body lost its weight. it is fun to play with shapes.<br>
            the body is as a piece of paper is.<br>
            i look at it as a reduction so i am only fooling this paper thing.<br>
            but this gives me space to see myself as form, negative and a positive one, as a closed line nonetheless. i’d like to be undifferentiated as an open one.<br>
            so i leaned on how to have a form is to have a body. the paper is a body.<br>
            fabric is as well,<br>
            i looked for form but form is accompanied.<br>
            and a motionless body doesn’t sound so good.<br>
            but i managed to turn it into stone, the fabric gave it breath.<br>
            transferred from paper to cloth, i did this to some built and chewed already<br>
            body of mine.<br>
            chewchewchew <br>
            <span class="hover-trigger">eu masco-me<br>
            eu como-me como uma goma,<br>
            <span class="hover-box">
            i chew myself/ i eat myself like gum <br>
            </span>
            </span>
            so then i wanted to make my form into a body of its own, it borrows from mine,<br>
            i trace my leg with fabric, and staple it as to sew it. our skin is familiar to that of a pillow, we stuff ourselves<br>
            and my leg is now an object, it furthered itself. stands away from me as my own does.´, something a drawn outline does in dreams<br>
            but i still play, bend it like i can’t. when in space, one shape is many. it is not my leg anymore i must remember, it is also chewed, if not more.<br>
            <span class="hover-trigger">eu como-me como uma goma e faço-a contornar-me,<br>
            <span class="hover-box">
            i eat myself like gum and make it contour me <br>
            </span>
            </span>
            as a cocoon built so i’d know where to live,<br>
            it is inhabitable<br>
            and i remember louise, my friend. she comes in thoughts,<br>
            legs for days,<br>
            i hope i get to keep them afterwards.<br>
            first person perspective of unseeable volume,<br>
            sounds a religious sentence.<br>
            let me bear one of yours so i step away and see as i am.<br>
            a selfish one for christianity<br>
            i try drawing what i sense,<br>
            i sense odd proportionality, i sense the edge of my back, unseeable,<br>
            i see it as i sense it bigger. volume is a tricky thing to have an idea of when you go from touch. my legs are no point of reference if i am blind.<br>
            ah the internal world remains far, as i created images ah.<br>
            there is no world to show, i’ll tell it as it is,<br>
            the outlines give me so<br>
            but if you wish to see me, do not look here<br>
            as i have lied<br>
            tracing myself, i trace you as well.<br>
            do you see you as you see me?<br>
            i trace myself so i touch what touches me and hope some clarity,<br>
            delusional as it may,<br>
